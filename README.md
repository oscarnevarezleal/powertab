powertab
========

Power tab is a basic chrome extention I build, it allows to duplicate tab, close tabs to the left, create a background tab, and copy tabs urls.

Feel free to fork the project our use it as a bootstrap for your next chrome extention.

Context menus features:

- Close tabs to the left
- Duplicate tab
- Get open tabs urls
- Open tab in background.
